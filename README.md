# 🤖 End To End Agentic Data Modeling: Using AI and OpenMetadata MCP for Impact Analysis

A complete, self-contained data analytics stack that automatically:
- Seeds marketing data from S3 into local PostgreSQL
- Runs dbt transformations to create analytics models
- Configures Metabase with pre-loaded database connections and metadata
- Provides unified metadata management via OpenMetadata
- Enables AI-powered data exploration through Claude

## 🔗 Unified Metadata with OpenMetadata

**OpenMetadata** serves as a unified metadata platform that easily connects different parts of the data engineering cycle. It acts as a central hub to:
- Ingest metadata from data sources, transformation tools (dbt), and visualization layers
- Build end-to-end lineage showing data flow from source tables → dbt models → dashboards
- Centralize documentation, schemas, column descriptions, and relationships
- Track dependencies and understand the downstream impact of changes

This provides a complete view of our data ecosystem, enabling you to explore metadata, view lineage, and understand dependencies across all your data assets.

## 💬 End To End Data Modeling with Claude & MCP Servers

This project connects Claude to the data stack through **two MCP servers**, giving AI direct access to both metadata intelligence and raw data:

| MCP Server | Purpose | Key Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenMetadata MCP** | Metadata catalog — lineage, search, glossaries, entity details | `search_metadata`, `get_entity_lineage`, `get_entity_details`, `create_glossary_term` |
| **PostgreSQL MCP** | Direct database access — query data, profile columns, validate models | `execute_sql`, `list_tables`, `list_table_stats` |

The **PostgreSQL MCP** uses [Google GenAI Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) (pre-downloaded binary in `bin/toolbox`) to give Claude direct SQL access to the local PostgreSQL instance. This enables data profiling, edge case discovery, and validation queries — capabilities used heavily by the AI Readiness skill.

The **OpenMetadata MCP** connects to the OpenMetadata server's native MCP endpoint, providing metadata search, lineage tracing, and glossary management through natural language.

Both servers are configured in `.mcp.json` at the project root, with permissions managed in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### What this enables

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions about your data architecture in plain English, such as "What tables feed into the `campaign_performance` model?" or "Show me all dashboards that use user data"
- **Intelligent Exploration**: Discover relationships and dependencies without manually navigating through the UI
- **Documentation Assistance**: Get instant answers about column meanings, data types, and business context
- **Lineage Visualization**: Understand data flows through conversational queries rather than complex graph navigation
- **Data Profiling**: Query the database directly to discover NULLs, distributions, edge cases, and grain violations
- **Impact Analysis**: Quickly identify what would be affected by changes to specific tables or models

## 🛠️ Claude Code Skills

The project includes three custom **Claude Code skills** (in `.claude/skills/`) that encode repeatable data engineering workflows as slash commands. These skills combine the OpenMetadata and PostgreSQL MCP tools with local file analysis to automate common tasks:

### `/metadata-impact-analysis`
Analyze downstream impact before making schema changes. Traces lineage through dbt models and dashboards to identify what breaks if a column is renamed, dropped, or its type changes.

### `/metadata-ai-readiness`
Audit and enrich dbt mart models for AI consumption. Checks schema quality, queries the database to discover edge cases, validates OpenMetadata catalog presence, and writes fixes back to dbt YAML.

### `/metadata-glossary`
Manage an OpenMetadata glossary derived from dbt models. Parses dbt YAML for column names and descriptions, groups them into business categories, and creates/syncs glossary terms via OpenMetadata.

## 📚 Documentation

This project includes comprehensive documentation to help you get started:

- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Step-by-step setup guide to get the entire stack running locally, including:
  - Docker environment setup (PostgreSQL, dbt, Metabase, OpenMetadata)
  - Metadata ingestion configuration
  - Claude Code MCP server connection

- **[DEMO.md](DEMO.md)** - Real-world use case demonstrations showing how AI + OpenMetadata enables:
  - Impact analysis before schema changes
  - Data discovery and validation
  - Lineage exploration and data provenance
  - Ownership and governance queries
  - AI readiness audits — enriching dbt models for AI consumption
  - Glossary management — deriving business terms from dbt into OpenMetadata

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Structure

- **Data Source**: PostgreSQL database
- **Transformation**: [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) for data modeling and transformation.
- **Visualisation**: [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) dashboards for business intelligence
- **Metadata Management**: [OpenMetadata](https://open-metadata.org/) to unify all metadata in one platform (hosted locally)
- **AI Integration**: OpenMetadata MCP + PostgreSQL MCP to connect with Claude Code and enable natural language queries, data profiling, and automated workflows via custom skills

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)

This setup enables a complete data analytics workflow where:
1. Raw data flows from PostgreSQL
2. dbt transforms and models the data locally
3. Metabase provides interactive dashboards
4. OpenMetadata centralizes metadata from all components via **YAML-based ingestion** (not UI), providing unified lineage and metadata views
5. Claude connects via two MCP servers (OpenMetadata + PostgreSQL) for metadata exploration and direct data access
6. Custom skills (`/metadata-impact-analysis`, `/metadata-ai-readiness`, `/metadata-glossary`) automate repeatable data engineering workflows

**Key Feature:** All OpenMetadata ingestion is configured through YAML files, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. Ingestion runs on-demand using Docker Compose profiles, giving you control over when metadata is synchronized. While OpenMetadata provides a UI for configuration, this project uses YAML files for version control, automation, and reproducibility.
